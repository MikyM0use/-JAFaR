 Just Another Fatshark Receiver Module


please refer to http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2619124 while I'm still writing the readme :)

the aim of the project is to build an opensource 40ch receiver for Fatshark goggles which has to be easy to develop, 
upgrade and maintain and cheap.

The project is mainly divided into two PCBs: one main base module and one "diversity" daughterboard.

the main module is usable alone as a 40ch receiver module, but if you connect the second external module, 
the microcontroller onboard can decide which one to use based on the received signal strength. 

on the base module the frequency is set by the user using an OSD menu.
